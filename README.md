##pomodoro timer??

Well if you google pomodoro you will come across tomatoes so whoever called it pomodoro missed out on a chance to call it Tomato timer
Podomoro timer allows you to schedule your tasks and break. It divides tasks to cycles, short breaks and long breaks.
Cycles by default are of 25 minutes, Short breaks 5 minutes (come after every cycle), Long breaks 15 minutes (come after 4 cycle). 
All times can be edited
